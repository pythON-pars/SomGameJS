# SomGameJS
This will be the simplest JS game, somewhat reminiscent of a manjog, when I remember the exact name, I will add.

Why I started writing the game myself, and all because I installed Ubuntu on my grandmother's laptop, and this is one of her favorite games (below will be the specifics). Since sometimes my grandmother gets lost in the space of advertising and other unnecessary web garbage. That's what inspired me to write this game.

This is a game where we have to find two identical elements/objects and connect them using direct rays (you can feel the use of graphs) to connect these two objects, after which they disappear. The game must also have a time frame.
